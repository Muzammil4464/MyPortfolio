        <h3 class="h32">Full Stack Web Development Intern – MERN Stack</h3>
        <p class="p13">Remote Internship | Feb 2025 – Present As a Full Stack Web Development Intern, I am actively working with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack to build dynamic, full-featured web applications. I have developed key skills in both frontend and backend development, working on real-world tasks such as building responsive UIs, managing state with React, and handling REST APIs using Express.js. During the internship, I focused on mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the frontend. I built multiple components, optimized for user experience, and followed industry-standard practices for clean code and responsive design. On the backend, I worked with Node.js and Express to build RESTful APIs, connect with databases, and handle CRUD operations. Though the stack includes MongoDB, I also explored MySQL for relational database handling in personal projects. I collaborated with mentors and fellow developers through weekly code reviews and team stand-ups, which helped improve my understanding of Git, version control, and team communication in a remote setup. This experience taught me how to work efficiently in an agile development environment and strengthened my problem-solving and debugging abilities.</p>

        <h3 class="h33">Project Lead – VoltCharge (Entrepreneurship Project)</h3>
        <p class="p14">VIT-AP University | Jan 2025 – Mar 2025 VoltCharge is a conceptual EV charging network designed to make electric vehicle charging more accessible and efficient. As the team lead, I was responsible for designing the platform’s core business model, user experience, and technical architecture. I conducted market research, competitor analysis, and created user personas to understand customer needs. I collaborated with my team to design the initial UI prototypes using HTML, CSS, and presentation tools. We developed a pitch deck and demo video as part of our entrepreneurship coursework, and presented it to mentors for feedback. This project gave me real experience in building an MVP, defining value propositions, and planning for future scalability. It also enhanced my presentation, leadership, and collaborative skills.</p>
